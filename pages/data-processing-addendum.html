                      <li>Smart Reporting agrees to:
                        <ol>
                          <li>only process Customer Personal Information for and on behalf of the Customer, in accordance with the instructions set out under the Terms or as otherwise given by the Customer from time to time.

                          <li>taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Smart Reporting, provide reasonable assistance to the Customer in ensuring compliance with its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation in relation to security, data breach notification, data protection impact assessments and prior consultation with a supervisory authority and the fulfilment of data subject’s rights, where applicable from time to time; and</li>
                          <li>upon written request, make available to the Customer such records as the Customer may reasonably require from time to time to demonstrate compliance by Smart Reporting with its obligations under this Addendum. In addition, Smart Reporting agrees to permit an audit to be conducted of its facilities no more than once per year, by the Customer or the Customer’s representatives (bound by appropriate obligations of confidentiality), provided such an audit is carried out: (i) upon ten (10) business days’ prior, written notice to Smart Reporting and during Smart Reporting’s normal business hours; (ii) in a manner that causes minimal disruption to Smart Reporting’s business and excludes from its scope any internal pricing information, information relating to other customers of Smart Reporting or other Smart Reporting’s own internal reports; and (iii) at the Customer’s own cost.</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>Smart Reporting shall notify the Customer without undue delay and in any event within 72 (seventy-two) hours of becoming aware of any accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of, or access to, Customer Personal Information ("Security Breach").

                    <ol>
                      <li>The Customer consents to Smart Reporting engaging subcontractors to process the Customer Personal Information on its behalf ("Sub-processors"). Smart Reporting shall ensure that Sub-processors are subject to contractual obligations which are the same as or equivalent to those imposed on Smart Reporting under this Addendum. Smart Reporting shall inform the Customer of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of any Sub-processor within a reasonable time prior to implementation of such change. In the event of the Customer objecting to such change, Smart Reporting shall make reasonable efforts to address the Customer's concerns (including making reasonable efforts to find an alternative Sub-processor).</li>

Smart Reporting shall implement a data transfer solution to ensure any such transfers are compliant with the Data Protection Legislation.</li>
                      <li>For the avoidance of doubt, where a Sub-processor fails to fulfil its obligations under any sub-contract, Smart Reporting shall remain fully liable to the Customer for the fulfilment of its obligations under this Addendum.</li>

                    </ol>
