                <p>
                  At Smart Reporting Inc. (“Smart Reporting”), your privacy is important to us. The purpose of this privacy statement is to let you know how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information, and to inform you of your rights with respect to such Personal Information. It is effective as of the Effective Date.
                </p>
                <h5>ABOUT SMART REPORTING</h5>
                <p>
                  Smart Reporting is an online service that enables its Customers to aggregate diverse data from multiple sources and quickly create a new, actionable perspective on their business (the “Service”).
                </p>
                <h5>APPLICABILITY OF PRIVACY STATEMENT</h5>
                <p>
                  This Privacy Statement relates to “Personal Information”, meaning information about an identifiable individual, whether, for example, that individual is our Customer, or our Customer’s provisioned user or an individual whose information is part of Processed Data, as these terms are defined below. Whether a person is “identifiable” means that they can be identified by the information itself or by that information combined with other information reasonably available.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This Privacy Statement applies to Personal Information collected or managed by Smart Reporting through the use of the Service and our websites. This Privacy Statement is also intended to explain how we use information which is not identifiable (and thus not Personal Information) that is collected via our websites and the Service.
                </p>
                <p>“Customer” refers to the customers of Smart Reporting and their provisioned users.</p>
                <p>“Customer Information” refers to information about our Customers and their provisioned users.</p>
                <p>“Processed Data” refers to information that is processed by Smart Reporting on behalf of our Customers through their use of the Service.</p>
                <p>Smart Reporting does not have a direct relationship with many of the individuals whose Personal Information is included in Processed Data, but this privacy statement is intended to provide information about how all Personal Information is collected, used, disclosed, processed and protected by Smart Reporting.</p>
                <h5>CLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION</h5>
                <p>
                  When the Service is used by our Customers, we classify the Personal Information we collect, use and disclose into two main categories: The first is Personal Information included in Customer Information, and the second is Personal Information that is included in Processed Data. It is important to note that not all Customer Information or Processed Data is Personal Information, either because it relates to a company or a business, or it is not identifiable.
                </p>
                <h5>PROCESSED DATA</h5>
                <p>Smart Reporting does not control what information a Customer chooses to include in Processed Data. Because we are unable to determine whether it is Personal Information or other information, we treat it as though it may be Personal Information but our Customers are entirely responsible for any Personal Information they choose to include in Processed Data. All Customers and their provisioned users should understand that data in Smart Reporting can be exported, shared or displayed by a Customer or provisioned user. Customers and provisioned users are solely responsible for the use of such exported, shared or displayed data and for protecting it appropriately.</p>
                <h5>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h5>
                <p>From our Customers, we only collect Customer Information that is necessary to establish and maintain the provision of the Service to them, as well as to understand and improve the usage and performance of the Service. When our Customers are corporations, as opposed to individuals, this information is not “Personal Information”. This Customer Information includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Customer name</li>
                  <li>Contact information, including postal and email addresses</li>
                  <li>Billing address</li>
                  <li>Billing details (as necessary for our internal accounting purposes and for processing payments through our contracted processing service)</li>
                  <li>Login information for authorized users, such as usernames and encrypted passwords</li>
                  <li>Information about how the Customer and its authorized users use the Service, including information about the Customer, location information, usage patterns and intended use of the Service.</li>
                  <li>Information provided by the Customer and its authorized users in connection with any support given by the Smart Reporting team related to the Service.</li>
                  <li>Login information for third party integrations to Smart Reporting, such as usernames and encrypted passwords</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In connection with our marketing, sales and Customer support functions, we may collect publicly-available information about our Customers and provisioned users, which is used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.</p>
                <h5>PURPOSES FOR COLLECTION</h5>
                <p>As stated in more detail in our Terms of Service, Smart Reporting does not use any identifiable Processed Data for its own purposes. Processed Data is only processed by Smart Reporting on behalf of our Customers to provide them with the Service. Individual provisioned users whose Personal Information is contained in Processed Data should refer to the Customer’s privacy policy for an understanding of how Personal Information is collected, used, disclosed and otherwise processed by the Customer by use of the Service.</p>
                <h5>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
                <p>Smart Reporting may share Personal Information with people within the company who have a “need to know” the information for business or legal reasons, for example, in order to carry out an administrative function, such as processing an invoice or supporting questions that you have submitted to Smart Reporting. We may share Personal Information with third parties, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>government and regulatory authorities, for example to respond to a legal request or comply with a legal obligation, in which case we will make reasonable efforts to give the relevant individual notice of the disclosure, provided we are able to identify the individual and are lawfully able to do so;</li>
                  <li>for the purposes of seeking legal or other professional advice;</li>
                  <li>suppliers of IT services and third service providers engaged by Smart Reporting as further detailed in this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Service and</li>
                  <li>in the event that we sell, buy or merge any business or assets, including to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets and their respective professional advisers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may also share anonymous or de-identified information with other third parties in connection with the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement.</p>
                <h5>RIGHT OF ACCESS</h5>
                <p>Pursuant to applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your Personal Information, including a right of access. If your Personal Information is a part of our Customer’s Processed Data, you should seek this access from the relevant Customer. If we control the Personal Information, we may require additional information to confirm your identity, which will only be used for that purpose.</p>
                <h5>DATA LOCATION</h5>
                <p>Unless a Customer is using a Custom Data Store and therefore storing their Processed Data on their site, Smart Reporting uses Amazon Web Services to store and manage Customer Information and Processed Data in and from the United States and to back up Customer Information and Processed Data in Ireland.</p>
                <h5>INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA OUR WEBSITE AND OUR APPLICATION</h5>
                <p>When you visit our websites, app.smartreporting.io and smartreporting.io, we may use cookies, pixel tags, analytics tools, and other similar technologies to help provide and improve our services to you, and as detailed below:</p>

                <h5>SAFEGUARDING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
                <p>We are required by law to safeguard the Personal Information in our custody or control. We use industry standard measures to protect Personal Information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. We protect Personal Information regardless of the format in which it is held.</p>
                <p>Our methods of protection include: (a) physical measures, such as restricted physical access to the systems delivering our Service; (b) organizational measures, including employee training and limiting access on a “need-to-know” basis; and, (c) technological measures, including the use of passwords and encryption. </p>
                <p>We use service providers, including our data hosting provider, to facilitate providing the Service. We use contractual means to make sure that our service providers only deal with Personal Information on our behalf to provide the Service and not for any other purposes. We also undertake diligence to satisfy ourselves that our service providers will implement adequate safeguards to protect Personal Information.</p>
                <p>If we have reason to believe that there has been a breach of security safeguards that has resulted in the inappropriate loss or disclosure of Personal Information, we will take reasonable measures to notify the affected Customers, as applicable, promptly and with sufficient detail to enable them to evaluate the breach and understand the likely consequences.</p>
                <h5>REVISIONS TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h5>
                <p>Smart Reporting may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. If it is updated, the effective date of the revision will be shown at the top of the Privacy Statement. In the event of a significant revision, Customers may receive notification by email or through the Service itself. All Personal Information collected after that revision date will be subject to the revised Privacy Statement.</p>
                <h5>ANONYMOUS INFORMATION</h5>
                <p>As stated in more detail in our Terms of Service, Smart Reporting may use de-identified and/or aggregate information derived from Personal Information, for any purposes, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Analytics to understand how our Customers and, their authorized users make use of the Service and our website and to make targeted offerings of certain Services to our Customers and authorized users;</li>
                  <li>Information used to determine how to make improvements to the Service and to develop new features, capabilities and ways of presenting data; and</li>
                  <li>For commercial purposes, either for Smart Reporting or for others.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will take industry standard steps so that this de-identified and/or aggregate information cannot be connected to any particular individual.</p>
                <h5>EU PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
                <p>This section shall apply only in respect of Personal Information relating to individuals located in the EU (“EU Personal Information”).</p>
                <p>For the purposes of applicable EU data protection and privacy laws, Smart Reporting, with its registered offices at 2035 Sunset Lake Road, Newark , Delaware, United States  is considered the Data Controller in respect of all EU Personal Information that it collects, uses and otherwise processes for its own purposes as set out in this Privacy Statement.</p>
                <p>If you are a Customer, website user or other individual with whom we communicate and / or do business and you are located in the EU, you should read this Privacy Statement in full and particularly this section, before you provide us with any Personal Information or browse our website, and make sure that you are comfortable with our privacy practices.</p>
                <p>Please note that for the purposes of EU data protection and privacy laws, personally identifiable information collected in a business context (for example an individual’s business email address or job title) will be Personal Information. All provisions in this Privacy Statement relating to Personal Information will therefore apply to Customer Information, to the extent that this is considered to contain Personal Information under EU laws.</p>
                <h5>PURPOSE OF PROCESSING</h5>
                <p>The purposes for which we process EU Personal Information are as set out in this Privacy Statement. In most cases, we will be processing EU Personal Information on behalf of a Customer as a Data Processor, but in certain circumstances we will process EU Personal Information as a Data Controller, including for the purposes of communicating with you, administering your account and for carrying out data analytics and enrichment.</p>
                <h5>LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING</h5>
                <p>In accordance with the purposes for which we collect and use EU Personal Information, as set out above, the legal basis for Smart Reporting processing EU Personal Information will typically be one of the following:</p>

                  <li>compliance with our legal obligations.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>

                <h5>INFORMATION TRANSFERS</h5>
                <p>In order to provide the Service and our website and as further detailed in the ‘Data Location’ section above, any EU Personal Information that we obtain may be transferred to and stored in a country outside the EEA. This may include transferring EU Personal Information to countries where the law provides less protection for Personal Information. If we transfer EU Personal Information to a country outside of the EEA, we will, as required by applicable law, ensure that your privacy rights are protected by appropriate safeguards. Please contact us if you would like more information about these safeguards.</p>
